You left me
you said that I was no good
upset me
like you knew you would
		
but does the sun stop shining ?
no!
does the stock market crash?

And though you tried in vain
to cause me deepest pain
life goes on without you
life goes on without you
life goes on 
without you

Unspoken
I had all I could stand
unbroken
I’m doing the best I can


cause does the rain quit falling? 
no!
do the seasons stop ?

And though you tried in vain
to cause me deepest pain
life goes on without you
life goes on without you
life goes on 
without you, oh...

do the tides stop turning?
no!
do the heavens shake ?

And though you tried in vain
to cause me deepest pain
life goes on without you
life goes on without you
life goes on 
without you.
