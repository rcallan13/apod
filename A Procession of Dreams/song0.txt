no more sleep
no, sleep must not come
these tired branches
these wasted legions
firefly dancing 
in the heat of the night
now is the time
when precise rhythms 						
begin to flow
out of one and all
dizzying
inexplicable
an ever-changing
shift of moods
an ever-changing 
shift of colors
oh bounteous night
oh bounteous night!

a procession of dreams
a mixture of heavens
a procession of dreams
a mixture of heavens
a procession of dreams
a mixture of heavens
from earth to heaven with a smile
from earth to heaven with a smile
