The seasons, they go round and round
one by one in a line
a mummified magnificence
where all we feel we can’t define
and one by one we’re heaven-sent
grief-stricken vows across the miles                           
as a hand reaches down                   
a hand to raise you                                               
from earth to heaven with a smile
from earth to heaven with a smile

Oh, it’s hard to free your head
from such a busy time						   
spoon-fed, force-fed, 
rammed down the throat, led-dead, 
nothing to do but all fall in line
but all the while I’ve been waiting
for the cosmic phone on which we dial                           
a prayer sent out
a message received       
from earth to heaven with a smile
from earth to heaven with a smile

Well, I could tell you stories
of countless griefs
of so many people crawling along                                    
like their hands are tied
behind their backs to their feet…

but still each morning they wake up                                  
and they wonder what’s going to come down
and they walk in the sunset	
walk by the seaside	                            
walking down to the old part of town

at the Judgement Gates they’re waiting,    
creating all their secret trials       					
when a hand comes down                                                                                       
a hand to raise them
from earth to heaven with a smile
from earth to heaven with a smile

It’s a fortress mentality
close the ranks and join the pack
and pile up the sandbags so high
combat boots and hard-hat helmets
and bulletproof glass enclosing the sky
and we brick up the windows
and we plastic up all the vents
surround ourselves behind the safety
of a cast-iron white picket fence
but then one day the doors all open
and they’re coming to the light after a while
and a million hearts 
and a million hands
sing
from earth to heaven with a smile
from earth to heaven with a smile
