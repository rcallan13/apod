so lush						                    
and the leaves
so green
one day
it stays like this
and then 
it all slips away

It all slips away
It all slips away
It all slips away

hold on                                   
hold on						        
our love is leaving             			        
so sad to see it go			                
our love is leaving                                         
I didn’t even know 			
(I didn’t even know)		
as it just all slipped away…      			        

It all slips away
It all slips away 
It all slips away

he could feel that world slipping away
the house green
with the vines and leaves coming down
situated at the back of a large garden
with a different kind of light
it was a world that was ending
he could feel it receding…

It all slips away
It all slips away
It all slips away

and once again
it all slips away….
