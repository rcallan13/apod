I have seen
your soul before me
I’ve been trying
to walk away							         
hurt so bad
thought you knew me
knew that I had 
nothing left to say

I have been alone too long			              
I’ve got a reason to move along

These are the reasons I was given
each one’s as good as the next			  
I try to list each one in order			     
I don’t expect that you’ll object		  

come back tomorrow
please make me stay						               
you got something for me
please don’t take it away
hurt me so softly
you heard what I meant to say

and these are the reasons I’m still here today	     

I tried to believe you
I tried to be kind
everything
is left behind
that’s what you said
when you changed your mind

I got three reasons						                        
each one’s as good as the next		    
I list each one in order				        
I don’t expect that you’ll object			               

As I must leave you
please let me go
It’s not a choice
I made easily
but it’s the only choice I know                                     
cause I must leave you
I must be gone
it’s taken four minutes
there’s one minute left
then I’ll be gone

I said I was sorry
I said I was wrong
but now I must leave you
now I’ll be gone

in the
early
mornin’ light
early
mornin’ light

let me go
let me go
as I must leave you
won't you let me go
